homebrew-web
============

This started off as an attempt of creating a small website for homebrew for people to search for available packages.

I kinda hacked together a really janky web front end for the package manager.

Since homebrew is git based, it has the potential for being a really cool distributed package manager.

Requirements:

  homebrew
  Rubygems (1.3.5+)
  Bundler

  TokyoCabinet
  TokyoCabinet Ruby Bindings (1.2.9) [http://gemcutter.org/gems/tokyocabinet]
  Sinatra
  Grit
  yajl-ruby

If you have bundler, you only have to worry about having TokyoCabinet.


To get started quickly, install homebrew and then:

  git clone git://github.com/melito/homebrew-web.git
  gem bundle
	rake bootstrap
	
Running `rake bootstrap` will do the following:

  Get a list of all homebrew network members
  Add each of those remembers as a remote in your homebrew install
  Fetch (non-destructive) each of those remotes
  Index all of the remotes blobs & branches in a tokyocabinet bdb

Once you've been 'bootstrapped' just run: 

  ruby app.rb && open http://0.0.0.0:4567

  Then just start typing a package name in the 'Search' box and a list of results should come up.

The interface is very minimal and not nice atm.
